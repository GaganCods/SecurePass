# SecurePass

**Know your password’s real strength.**

SecurePass is a modern, privacy-focused password strength analyzer and generator built entirely on the client side.

It helps users understand how secure their passwords are by measuring entropy, estimating crack time using modern brute-force assumptions, and providing intelligent improvement suggestions — without ever sending data to a server.

Everything runs locally in the browser. No backend. No database. No tracking.

## 🔐 Features

- **Real-time password strength analysis**
- **Entropy calculation**
- **Crack-time estimation**
- **Smart password improvement**
- **Secure password generator**
- **Passphrase generation mode**
- **Exclude ambiguous characters**
- **Require selected character types**
- **Fully responsive design**
- **Dark and light mode support**
- **100% client-side processing**

## 🛡 Privacy First

SecurePass does not:

- Store passwords
- Transmit data to servers
- Use a backend
- Log user inputs

All analysis happens locally in the browser using JavaScript.

## ⚙ How It Works

SecurePass evaluates password strength based on:

- Character pool size
- Length
- Entropy (bits of randomness)
- Estimated brute-force attack speeds

The crack-time estimation is calculated using modern GPU-based attack assumptions to provide a realistic security benchmark.

## 🚀 Why SecurePass?

Most password tools either analyze or generate.

SecurePass does both — and can intelligently improve weak passwords while preserving the original structure.

It’s built to be transparent, fast, and privacy-focused.
